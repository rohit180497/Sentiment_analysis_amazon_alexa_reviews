142,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool."
1072,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"Terrific sound for a small device, and nice form factor for the nightstand. I like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking Alexa. Not using video much, but it would be nice if the device had a square/rectangular screen."
2258,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Use it all the time and love it. Very quality product.
1142,4,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"Works decent, wish it was able to answer more questions....need a better source for info but the rest works great!"
1116,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Great for checking in on my son after school when I'm still at work.  Love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so I can plan my route accordingly

2832,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love my echo. Love playing music in my room
2626,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????
173,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.
1889,4,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"Wish it would have came with the lightbulb, but otherwise works great, fast delivery, and I enjoy using it!"

169,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call."
2779,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Use the product for music and it‚Äôs great!
476,5,28-Jun-18,Black,It works
363,5,28-Jul-18,Black,"This is our 5th Amazon Echo device.  We have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied, this time is no different.  You can't tell this from brand new, and the price was $10 cheaper.  Our Echo's wake us up, keep timers, play music for us, act as encyclopedias, turn our lights on and off and so much more."
112,4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that."
1560,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,"I love the Echo Show!! I have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months,  but the Show is so much better.  The sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4K tv.  I love being able to see my timers, events and list instead of having them read to me.  I purchased this on prime day, and it is worth every penny.  When the dot was given to me, I thought ""this is a cute novelty,  but I'll probably never use it"". Was I wrong!!  Echo is part of my daily routine,  and has made my life so much easier."
793,4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love it!
2709,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do"
2212,4,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Love it. The only downside is that you can't download any app you want.
1095,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,Love my Echo Spot!
375,5,26-Jul-18,White,Bought for my bathroom to listen when I'm in the shower.  Love it.
2171,4,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"The selection is wonderful and the ease of use on the home page is nice. I wish, however, it didn't keep overcoming my settings for my other devices attached to my TV.  I have to keep switching back after any switches in programming, including my stereo."
816,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.
826,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her."
319,5,29-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music."

2222,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Loved it. No more cable bills for us.  I would advise anyone to get one. 2nd one bought.
1205,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,The amazon Alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the Alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen!
1247,4,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"Love that I have command access to news such as Bloomberg TV, NPR, etc.Highly recommend that you gain access to Alexa app before setting up Device and get familiar with key features/services...such as setting up your daily commute.If family and friends have Spot...then it‚Äôs a great substitute for Skype and Face Time...you can always ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù when missing loved ones or just to catch up."
2539,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to.  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker.  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot.  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered.
754,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs
177,5,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,Entertainment
1136,3,29-Jul-18,White  Spot,I am huge Amazon fan! First to have a kindle and the echo. I waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile. I do love it!! My kids love it! They love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs. Now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out. I thought as long as someone would FaceTime me I could do it through that and I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs Spot to Spot. Can‚Äôt even Skype (which I do often with my aunt). The is my major disappointment with it.
2550,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"Great price.  I love my echo dot,"
1526,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,"Great sound and the screen is nice to actually see time, trivia, etc."
1776,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Is amazing I have all 3 and I love this
2507,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"Alarm,bed time story, universal"
1547,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,"Show has been great. Still learning what it can do, but being able to watch videos, talk face to face with others are not features."
737,4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,So far so good
2674,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!"
2982,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier
1115,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"I like how small it is, but I‚Äôm still able to see my Ring cameras."
1859,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Great product and fast shipping. Thank you
2620,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Set up is so easy.
2345,4,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,It offers hours of entertainment and it was very easy to install and activate üëç
851,4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries."
1442,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,"This is great for music, video calling, kitchen timers, and probably a bunch more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever-floating ""things to try"" on the home screen. This is purely an aesthetic complaint, but hopefully soon Amazon allows the option to shut it off."
402,4,18-Jul-18,Black,Divertido
350,1,31-Jul-18,Black,Item no longer works after just 5 months of use. Will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.
2363,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Setup was easy and usage was intuitive.  I've used it away from home and it works great.
2211,4,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"I love this, it's quick and easy to use. I love that there are so many apps you can access but disappointed some of them cost extra money to use. I also love the music app on here. I didn't think I would use it because I have Alexa echo and listen to music all the time on there. But I tried it on the fire tv and it gives you the lyric as the songs play! Love it!!"
1681,4,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,It is great. But it would be better there was a way to use headphones with it.
3005,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"As Always, easy to set up"
2443,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Great product and easy to use
883,3,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.
2824,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,The speaker could be better...
1159,3,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,It won‚Äôt receive calls and it‚Äôs really hard to call someone who has another echo.
1249,4,26-Jul-18,White  Spot,"It is a good addition to my small space, and it keeps me up to date on events and weather conditions."
1785,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"It's a great product with many good aspects, it easy to setup and control with intuitive straight forward instructions. The included lightbulb was excellent and worked perfectly. I very much enjoy this product and recommend it."
359,5,29-Jul-18,White,This is our 2nd one and we love it!
1264,5,25-Jul-18,White  Spot,I love my echo spot!
1240,2,26-Jul-18,White  Spot,I haven't figured out how to make or receive calls.  Device tells me I need to register and I do not know what to do.
3093,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Use as my 3rd dot. Bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesn't have access to phone.
1682,4,28-Jul-18,White  Show,"So far so good,  much better sound than my Echo Dot"
2803,5,31-Jul-18,Black  Dot,beyond awesome
1654,4,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,Ight
2445,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Excellent product and service.  Very easy to install and my daughter is very happy.
2456,4,31-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.
91,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,The speaker sounds really good
2713,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It‚Äôs great for my news updates too!
2216,4,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,I love my fire stick
2410,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Love how I can take it on vacation and use it. Very easy to set up.
1266,5,25-Jul-18,White  Spot,"What a great little gadget for the house. You ask and it delivers, period. Well done!"
1349,5,19-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love everything about this product I bought two one for my household and one for my mother in law just so we can video chat with her and for emergency and it‚Äôs easy to use for older folks.
2523,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,its okay but keeps dropping wifi!
15,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"I love it, wife hates it."
2900,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,love it...just like the other 4 I own.
1637,3,29-Jul-18,White  Show,"The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates."

1451,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,"I purchased echo about 2 weeks ago , I love this product, I would definitely recommend"
1777,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"Awesome product, very responsive!Alexa just needs more content and variety when it comes to music. It uses the Bing search engine instead of google. If only the two could combine. It would be a perfect product."
2662,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot, 
1756,5,30-Jul-18,White  Plus,Happy with Echo Plus. Having fun learning what I can do with it.
3058,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????"
2312,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,i do wish the dot could connect to the fire stick but both products still worked flawlessly
271,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.
739,5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,Great
2598,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such."
56,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.
567,1,11-Jun-18,White,"Very bad this device, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded"
1368,5,18-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"Installed on my back porch, works very well!  I did have to get the wall mount for it, which also works well."
2874,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,its okay but keeps dropping wifi!
2393,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Access to apps
1256,5,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"I have two. One in my computer room and the other that I move around out on the deck. Not great for watching video, but it can be done. With the added sound you don't get from the Echo Dot, it is perfect for the location I have it in. Add whole house music, and you have just arrived in Nervana."
2274,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"My 90 year old Mom LOVES that she can watch the 1st Season of Blue Bloods ‚ù§. My one wish is that she could watch CSI:MIAMI...without having to pay for it...üò• The bill for OPTIMUM is already, quite high. Can you help us? We live on Long Island, NY (Suffolk County )"
2585,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.
2834,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn‚Äôt know. I thought she was supposed to know everything
2535,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"Hard to hear, had to blue tooth it to a better speaker."
882,2,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa."
2934,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one."
2110,5,31-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,I put it on a TV that didn‚Äôt have a great picture and it now looks like a new TV
2581,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!
578,5,10-Jun-18,Black,"Works great, can't tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode.  I have 3 in my home and will be adding more. I love these things."
957,5,29-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,Arrived as expected.

3145,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!"
1822,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,It works perfect!
1507,5,30-Jul-18,White  Show,"Used to have fun with. Great to play music, turn on lights and who know what else."
1273,5,24-Jul-18,White  Spot,"I am not easily impressed with electronic goodies. But...OMG this is by far the coolest thing I have ever had.  It does everything short of clean your house... which, when I asked Alexa to clean my house.... was told she didn‚Äôt have hands, but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning!  From reading books to my five year old, to video chat, to silly selfies, music that automatically goes to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, setting timers, alarms, changing my thermostat on voice command, tells me the weather, sends hubby a grocery pick up list, and I am sure. Million more things!BUY IT.....you u will not regret it."
2780,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy to set-up and to use.
340,5,28-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.

2675,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now."
2049,5,12-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"I love Alexa, she works great but she not for little children. She doesn't understand if you don't speak clearly. She fun to have"
2566,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.

1048,5,28-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Alexa is easy to operate and set up.  Have had it for about 10 days now and love it.
1421,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,Oh I love my Echo Show and the video news spots
2746,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I have a friend now.
57,4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Great sound and easy to set up.
2655,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.
3064,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It‚Äôs great for my news updates too!

685,4,18-May-18,Black,"Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great. Sound is perfect for background music, would suggest 2-or more connected together if you‚Äôre trying to use for hosting a louder party"
595,4,6-Jun-18,Black,works as promised
1880,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"I haven't had it very long, but so far our whole family is enjoying asking Alexa questions!"
1970,3,25-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"Device is touted as able to link to calendar on my Samsung phone through google, can't get it to work"
2807,4,31-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.
3001,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.

1714,5,28-Jul-18,White  Show,Bought for my older grandparent to help with reminders. Would recommend to anyone with someone in their life with dementia or memory loss. Helps my grandmother remember to take medications and do daily task. She loves it because she can listen to music and ask questions

279,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Works great! Perfect for my office!
1979,2,24-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Doesn't use apple music.  It is worthless to me without it.  Sound quality on it is also poor.
2352,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,We like it better than Roku.  Voice commands really work.
2846,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Great product at a great price.
2734,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Really like it
822,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.
1409,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,Tremendous way to communicate with friends and family all across the country
1317,5,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"I needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly.  I am a believer in amazon echo, Alexa and fire.  Great customization options and Alexa is always helpful.  Sound quality is also surprisingly good."
1595,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,No enough video options
1214,5,27-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"Purchased this on Prime Day and I absolutely love it!  I had the Echo Dot on my nightstand, but I really missed a display. This is perfect and the speakers are excellent."
1241,5,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"I need to get some better controls for custom displays and the ability to make my own clock, but that's asking a lot. In general, great device; glad I got it."
2090,5,2-Jul-18,White  Plus,"I am the Training Coordinator at my company and I have used the Amazon Blueprints skill with an Echo device and Echo Buttons to create my own Gameshow/Quiz for new hire orientation training. I'm always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable. I believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they're much more likely to remember the information. So far, this has been a huge success with my classes and I look forward to Amazon improving and building out the Blueprints skill further!"
148,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.
905,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Absolutely love!!
1744,2,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,"This was my 4th echo device, 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential, and I really wanted to like it, but soon found out it is quite limited. A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh."
1167,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love this. So glad I purchased
74,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,She doesn‚Äôt always listen
3099,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Good device
644,3,27-May-18,Black,"It works great, but the reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available."
413,5,13-Jul-18,Black,"I love you, Alexa!"
1168,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I wanted to see my security video cameras without having to use my phone. Works great and extremely easy to set up.
266,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,It‚Äôs smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.
29,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Just like the other one
2039,3,16-Jul-18,White  Plus,"Alexa is a decent speaker if that's all you need. She is terrible at most other things. She consistently answers questions that were not asked or says &#34;hmmm I don't know that&#34; for everything else. We've gone back to just using our phones because she can't really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when I had an awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I'm less than impressed. I'd never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall."
2660,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.
2597,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.
2739,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,as expected
2401,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Fun to play with
1151,5,29-Jul-18,White  Spot, 
3019,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.
3017,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed."
620,1,31-May-18,White,"Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong."
638,5,28-May-18,White,"Just like new, set-up was quick & easy."
2234,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"Recently cut the cord on cable television. Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed."
1370,5,18-Jul-18,White  Spot,"I love this thing. At first I thought it wouldn‚Äôt stay on the clock and that I would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it‚Äôs very comfortable for the eyes, easy set up. Love it"
274,5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Very easy setup.
2336,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Super easy to set up.  Easy to use. Lots of app options available.
14,5,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,Just what I expected....
2591,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I really like it .
2568,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps."
2760,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.
2748,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Good device
702,5,31-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.
2015,5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"Alexa helps with more than just lights or music, it helps out when your kids think they know everything and you know nothing  lol  Sweet  love it  so much so I purchased 2, Alexa has been a great purchase for my uncle whom lives by himself, when I got it he wasnt so keen on it, but now its his best friend, he tells her goodmorning and she will say it back along with a description on something that is happening today or something special that happened years ago on that day, as well as sang him Happy birthday  lolol  he now has educated him self on things he never knew, and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something hes asked  love it, and to think I was going to hate it."
296,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Very easy to set up and have no issues.
1459,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,"The Echo Show is ok, however the constant suggestions about what to ask Alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it. Also, I thought I could have the weather for an area displayed continuously,  but I have to talk to Alexa, which I don't want to do in the middle of the night. Had I payed full price it would have been returned. There are other features that are nice, but I may never use them."
2547,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Clear sound, great alarm clock, plays my music.  What else can you ask for.  Oh yeah, you can order what you need."
313,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off."
498,4,25-Jun-18,Black,Was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all
721,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge."
2079,5,4-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Alexa us funny and enjoyable. Nice sound
605,2,5-Jun-18,Black,It doesn‚Äôt always  work
1608,5,29-Jul-18,White  Show,This is the best of my echo devices and I own a spot a dot and echo
415,5,13-Jul-18,Black,Iove it I bought it for my son because he wanted it and it‚Äôs awesome
642,5,27-May-18,Black,I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high.
1296,5,23-Jul-18,Black  Spot,It every ting I thought it would be plus more.  This will be going to my MOM right after I get through playing with it.
2283,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Great product
831,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Still love it
1029,5,28-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love it.
1083,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,Responds easily and like the ability to do at night.
2558,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn‚Äôt know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don‚Äôt. Lastly, I‚Äôm sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù."
2812,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!"
1911,4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Still needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don't need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.
1212,5,27-Jul-18,White  Spot,Excelente su funcionamiento y llama la atenci√≥n la rapidez de respuesta y el control que se logra a trav√©s de la utilizaci√≥n con Alexa. Me sorprendi√≥ gratamente. Muy recomendable.
521,1,21-Jun-18,White,"Two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  No connection, no light, no sound.  I guess I shouldn't have purchased a refurbished Dot."
434,1,9-Jul-18,Black,"&#34;NEVER BUY CERTIFIED AND REFURBISHED ECHO DOT &#34; I bought a &#34;Certified and Refurbished &#34; Echo Dot. This unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. Never buy a refurbished Echo dot. The unit I received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. I also bought a new ECHO dot, it works perfectly.Very disappointed !!!!"
484,4,27-Jun-18,White,"A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited..."
1065,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,We absolutely love this product!!! Wish we would have bought this instead of the dots!!!
1675,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,I bought this after visiting a friend who had one and it is great.  I understand the frustration of not having YouTube though.  Still good to have-love seeing the words to songs and if you have the Ring doorbell-you never have to get up from your chair...laziness at it's best!  LOL  All in all- a great product with good speakers.
1745,4,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,Love it to play music works great for finding recipes. Need more family to have adapted machines to see
1557,4,30-Jul-18,White  Show,"I basically use it to play music  and tell me the news..its sometimes hard to communicate with it, if i dont say the command correctly, but i realize its learning my style of speaking and will do some commands even though i dont say them exactly as i should."
228,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Very amazing product. Great sound quality.
2423,4,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"I like this product. However, the set up was a bit difficult. I had to reset it to the factory setting abd start from scratch."
40,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities
1716,2,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,Need to be able to connect to more 3rd party viceo apps
1287,5,23-Jul-18,Black  Spot,***Love it***
2267,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Great ! It was the best decision ! Especially if you have Amazon Prime.
2766,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom
1036,1,28-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Alexa hardly came on..
658,5,25-May-18,White,Works perfectly
1076,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm. Works great. Every morning I get the weather and news when I get up. Also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and I have.
3029,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. üòÇ Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.
3148,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers."
254,4,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me."
487,5,26-Jun-18,Black,"So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed."
384,4,25-Jul-18,Black,love it
2457,5,31-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.
1817,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"I'm so happy that I purchased Alexa.  When I recently saw this at a friend's home, he played some music while talking about the product.  I love the sound & love that all I have to do is tell Alexa or ask a question & she responds immediately.  I haven't been able to listen to my CD's for a while since I have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it's not an issue any longer."
1929,4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,I love my Echo Plus. The only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors.
1942,4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,I like how easy it was to set up. Very easy to use and set up with other Bluetooth devices.
612,4,3-Jun-18,Black,Worked as advertised. Thanks
2842,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for."
1697,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,"Great product, great price on Prime Day.  Thanks Alexa!"
2319,3,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,That it doesn‚Äôt turn my television on or off.
1571,2,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,All of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with Sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account. Asking any echo device to play music on Sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. This went on for two weeks until I eventually solved the problem that neither Amazon nor Sonos could figure out.
1060,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"Overall it's great and I like that I can see lyrics and the time and  date. However, sometimes it freezes and doesn't respond properly--no error message about lack of connectivity--it just stops. Resetting resolves the problem."
2493,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa"
3070,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Too soon, I'm still learning what I can do with it."
2237,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Really enjoying my firestick can‚Äôt wait to get rid of  cable such a waste of money.
2672,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound."
137,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love it
499,1,25-Jun-18,Black,"Now I'm weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet."
218,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,We enjoy it
999,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information
2694,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.

3059,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.

2765,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.
298,4,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.
2805,5,31-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Family loved it!
741,2,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals."
1235,5,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,It was easy set up.  I use it more than I thought.
1723,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,Great product
2017,4,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Easy to Install. Very clear speaker. I took one star off because it was delivered late by OnTrac-like usual.
2989,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.
2091,4,1-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"This is a great tool (toy?), room-filling music, very convenient to use, just fun to have. Why only 4 stars? Supposed to work with Logitech Harmony remote: nope. Supposed to work with Denon AV receivers: nope. This may not be Amazon't fault, but advertised skills should actually work. We also have the Echo Show, and the Ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door."
1506,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,LOVE MY ECHO SHOW.  Everything about this device is wonderful
2711,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done."

662,4,24-May-18,Black,Overall it works very well. Some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money!
1597,4,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,I took advantage of prime Friday and decided to take a chance and purchase one.  I enjoy the features it comes with. I'm sorry I didn't purchase two of them  Well worth the money.  Its looks great on my nightstand.  Every night it puts me to steep with sleeping music.  Happy customer!
3032,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it's a great value"

269,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights."
1524,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,Very Good to be able to listen to Every single song at any time in Amazon's vast library. We're only just beginning to know everything Echo Show has to offer. Well worth the price!! Alexa is very helpful.
2209,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Great product. Very versatile and easy to use
1008,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off."
890,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Works as advertised
1331,5,20-Jul-18,Black  Spot,love my spot
1621,1,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,"I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could."
2794,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!"
2685,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy to set up and does everything it‚Äôs a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.
3096,1,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn‚Äôt need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.
1392,5,16-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Perfect
2179,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,ok
1809,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"I love my echo plus. I haven't one bad thing to say. It controller music when I need it too. With a great sounding 360 speaker. I also bought a 4k fire TV and it can open Amazon prime video or Netflix at any moment. The included hue lighting makes this product even better. I found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room. The addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer. Alexa will controll it all as soon as you say ""Hey Alexa"". And if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device. This is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort."
2728,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house
373,1,27-Jul-18,Black,I'm an Echo fan but this one did not work
90,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!
1925,5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Use way more often than we used our Google Home.

We are really enjoying our Echo Spot. It reads stories to our girls, plays music, gives us the news, and so much more!  It's so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy."
2011,5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"love Alexa, makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time"

1591,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,I loved talking it out of the box and being able to easily set up.
2625,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"I'm finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!"
2666,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed."
3119,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It's pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn't understand my commands some of the time.
1888,4,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Like it but it will take time to setup all the skills I want simply because there are so many. I already use music and Flash Briefing daily. Very satisfied. I use this along with Alexa app on my Kindle hd8
2385,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Love the fire stick. Alexa works well on it too. Would recommend.

I purchased on Prime Day plus I used rewards to pay for it, so in the end I paid next to nothing. If I had paid full price for it I might want my money back. We stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device. I know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from."

1984,5,23-Jul-18,Black  Plus,So far I love it.  It was easy to set up - if I can do it anybody can.  Speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command!
3008,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Review
1510,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,"this is so fun! I really enjoy using it. I have it hooked up to one of my lights so I just tell Alexa when I want that on and off. also, it connects to my Spotify so I just have Alexa resume my playlist and we pick off right where we ended. I feel like there's even more I can do with this, so I'm excited to use it more!"
1259,5,25-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love it!
563,3,12-Jun-18,Black,"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough ‚Äî plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone‚Äôs WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I‚Äôve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I‚Äôm not sure if this is the norm or if it‚Äôs because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don‚Äôt have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic‚Äôs range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple‚Äôs Siri is that when she‚Äôs playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven‚Äôt tried this with louder speakers yet, so I‚Äôm not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations ‚Äî support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can‚Äôt handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would‚Äôve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don‚Äôt want to though ‚Äî Alexa‚Äôs kind of growing on me."
1268,5,25-Jul-18,Black  Spot,My favorite Echo. A more than adequate replacement for a clock radio.

2008,1,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won‚Äôt allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I‚Äôd bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I‚Äôll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights."
206,4,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.

1804,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"Not perfect but very good! A few times Alexa picked up something from TV, and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things. If you call something &#34;light&#34; in the app you need to say light, not &#34;lights.&#34; Echo Plus has no problems as a smart hub but I could use better user directions. Well worth owning and a good step to making my home Smart!"

1312,5,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,After purchasing my Echo Spot to add to our other 4 Amazon Echoes...I am very pleased with the Echo Spot...I use  it with our Arlo Security cameras and Ring video doorbell and works without any problems...

She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again."
166,3,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected

810,4,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product."

2946,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing."
879,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her ‚Äúno‚Äù for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It‚Äôs that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you‚Äôre going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou‚Äôll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn‚Äôt live without."

636,5,28-May-18,Black,Very fun to use and having morning briefing
1380,4,17-Jul-18,White  Spot,"Much easier to use than the dot. It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding The screen is a nice perk but I only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..It displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  My only complaint is that they don't add the stand as standard. I didn't need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.Many people complain about the basic Alexa program but it is still such new tech that I'm not going to split hairs.  The echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  Alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. I think Amazon is working overtime on this project. I gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.I am so used to my Alexa that I talk to her even when I'm staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found.  Alexa, what time is it?  ALEXA???!!"
1853,5,28-Jul-18,White  Plus,Comes with a hub.  Got it during prime day for $99 and a hue white bulb.  Works great.  Now I can add more stuff that required a hub!

911,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well."

5,5,31-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can‚Äôt wait to see what else it can do."
1329,3,20-Jul-18,White  Spot,"I bought this to replace a Dot in my bedroom. Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.-the major one, also involves the Show: I'm very used to these devices. I don't need to see &#34;Things to Try&#34; whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I'm not a child and I don't need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn't Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off? I want to see a clock face, period, not these silly nanny reminders."
492,5,25-Jun-18,Black,"The refurbished echo for has been wonderful. I purchased this for my mother. She loves the ability to contact me without a phone, listen to music, weather, and ask questions. It's been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems"
1992,5,22-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Exactly what I wanted with speedy shipping.....thank you so much!
1390,5,16-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"I love this thing! It plays my books from audible or prime music and sets my alarms! If you‚Äôre considering purchasing one, get it. It‚Äôs worth it."
2853,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"What can I say. Well, I‚Äôm a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that‚Äôs not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled."
576,1,10-Jun-18,Black,So far not impressed at all. Does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time I'm not sure what the excitement is all about. Alexas voice sounds like it's under water how am I supposed to understand!!!!I'm going to return and try a google home!!!
2714,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It works just like my other Dots.
2130,4,31-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,One problem you need to buy an app from amazon to mirroring your iphone .. app price 2.99$ .. other than that the device is perfect
2480,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Nice product
1816,5,29-Jul-18,White  Plus,"I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub. I'm in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. For the same price as some hub's, and even less expensive in some other cases. I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven't even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I've already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn't even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn't know it was a hub. But also because I didn't really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you're looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras. Well, that just put the Echo Plus over the top."
1436,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,Love all my Echo products. I like the video phone feature on this. Can check in on our cat when on vacation.

162,1,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?"
1189,2,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom.  But the font is too small to see from any distance.  And apparently you can't change it.
706,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times
2444,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"Great gadget that installs, and works easily. Nice to not have another box taking up space too!"
2651,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It isn‚Äôt bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it‚Äôs not bad for the sale price I paid.
2786,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Very convenient
2926,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"Love it , Now if I can only find the correct smart (links)Plug to connect this too"

22,4,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it‚Äôs not intrusive to look at."
973,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I love it!!
2917,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.
2416,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"Already had a firestick in our livingroom, great entertainment, had to get one for the bedroom."
2126,5,31-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Very easy to install. Voice control is great.
2727,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom
1086,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"I was skeptical at first but &#34;it&#34; grows on you.  It looks good, so far.  I did, however, turn off the camera."
1261,3,25-Jul-18,White  Spot,"I have the dot and Echo Plus, this one can't seem to &#34;hear&#34; me as well and doesn't do as much as I expected."
1284,5,24-Jul-18,White  Spot,very nice gadget. love it's look.
2851,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.
809,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.
2238,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Good
351,5,30-Jul-18,Black,I love the Echo Dot. So easy. So fun. I get to drop in on my Grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. Sounds like she is right next to me.
2215,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,My Father liked the added programing in which he is interested.
1099,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,"Bought this for my bedroom and the Show for my living room. Love them both. The Spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design. Shows lyrics, photos , etc. I paired it with a Smart Plug for the bedroom lamps &#34;Alexa, turn off lights&#34;, love it."
3134,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,PHENOMENAL
260,5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!
3107,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.
856,5,30-Jul-18,Walnut Finish ,We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.
894,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.
3108,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"I live alone, this is the best companion!"
2316,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Great easy to set up.A little difficult to navigate and the instructions are non existent
1196,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Great device
811,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn‚Äôt be happier!"
1013,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"My  wife & I enjoy the ease of playing our music. The games are fun & entertaining, I look forward to adding more smart products to my home."
569,5,11-Jun-18,Black,Adding more rooms for convenience
1727,1,28-Jul-18,White  Show,The tech isn‚Äôt there. It doesn‚Äôt understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio
2063,5,8-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Expensive but it is a slightly better sound than my Original Echo.
3079,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house
2506,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol"
844,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.
431,5,9-Jul-18,Black,We have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  Can't wait to try more new stuff using Alexa!
186,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Easy set up very user friendly
2492,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"It won‚Äôt work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won‚Äôt work"
123,4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Initially harder to set up called tech wasn‚Äôt that knowledgeable now working great.
308,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.
865,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Good Value
2971,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Set up is so easy.
2224,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"absolutely an amazing device, very easy to setup and use"
2742,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Use as my 3rd dot. Bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesn't have access to phone.
1719,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,"I own two dots, a tap and a show. I love the echo show. Sound quality is amazing compared to the dots. I use mine constantly to create shopping list, kitchen and laundry timer, and news updates. But most of all I have the all throughout the house and I play music throughout using the group settings"
3048,1,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(
2027,5,18-Jul-18,White  Plus,The Echo Plus works as expected but I never received the Philips Hue smart bulb that was supposed to be included as part of my purchase. Please advise.
723,4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."
2893,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,This is pretty cool
263,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard."
2296,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Best streaming device on the market. I now own 3.
136,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Still love it
292,5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.
804,4,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.
827,4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it."
2643,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Good speaker for bedroom or office
88,5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.
1330,5,20-Jul-18,Black  Spot,This product just looks adorable in any room and I love it. I recently just bought my mom one as a gift on Prime Day and she can't wait to use it.
631,1,30-May-18,White,Eh. It‚Äôs works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine
2180,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,I loved it so much on my living room TV that I bought one for the bedroom TV. Highly recommend this device to anyone wanting to simplify and improve their online entertainment experience.
734,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!"
2751,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices."
1950,4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,It's like a remedial form of the Star Trek computer in your home
2799,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Nice little unit  no issues
1742,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,I have been waiting for the Echo Show to go on sale and it was worth the wait. It was easy to set up and start using
1071,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,I love the way it is designed. And you have choices for the face.  I use it for my bed side.  I drop in; on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling.
1875,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,First time using Alexa and so far I love it.
1209,1,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,"This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it's an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time. Have rebooted the device, re-set, etc etc.Until these two obvious software issues are fixed, in my opinion the product is useless."
1182,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Fun to work with still learning everything she can do
321,5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great."
690,5,17-May-18,Black,Works great
1983,2,23-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked."
1091,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"So far pretty happy with the Spot. For me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and I know I could have something more cost effective but eh, I like it. I had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. So far so good."
979,5,29-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.
2763,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot, 
3051,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time
2012,3,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"I was suppose to get the ‚Äúfree‚Äù lightbulb with purchase. It did not come with Echo. Upon reading more carefully, it says to click a box to receive free bulb. üò≥ of course I want the free bulb, who wouldn‚Äôt? Just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many ‚Äú free‚Äù  bulbs away. Disappointed!  I have yet to set up my echo, our first purchase on any alexia device. Debating if we want to keep it. It did come quickly with my prime membership."
1417,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,"I LOVE THIS ITEM... I UNDERESTIMATED THIS ITEM, I HAVE ANOTHER 2 IN MY CART ... BUT I'M WAITING FOR THE SAME DEAL AGAIN!!!, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM!"
3120,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot, 
2975,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!"
481,5,27-Jun-18,Black,I got this for my mom . She loves it !
379,5,26-Jul-18,White,LOVE LOVE LOVE my new and free assistant!  :)
2530,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Fun To interact with
1336,5,20-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I like the Echo Spot because it fits into my decor and I can also sing along with my favorite songs
1740,5,28-Jul-18,White  Show,We like the video calling feature. We got this so we can be in contact with our elderly parents and it works well
2866,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,The volume is very low
3018,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Totally gets out sense of humour
2351,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,"Very satisfied, easy setup. Great product. Highly recommend."
2414,1,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,I would love this remote if i wasnt spending so much money replacing the batteries. Its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last.
1808,5,29-Jul-18,White  Plus, 
1058,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"I bought on Prime Day and so glad I did. It‚Äôs easy to use and lots of customization options. I know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read, but I disagree."
3117,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom
1811,5,29-Jul-18,White  Plus,Home entertainment.
1868,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"Easy setup with great sound, I would rate this unit a 10 +++++, and a must have for the office and home. l am looking add other devices (locks, and lights) for my home."
1238,5,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"Bedroom clock , ask questions,  weather reportsAlarm clock ‚è∞. Music üé∂ download music"
2962,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace."
886,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.
1281,5,24-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"Got for elderly parents,easy for them to use.just instructions could be more informative"
200,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,A great device
1650,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,I love the simple set up I love the fact that it has all the answers to most of the questions that I have I bought one for everybody in my family so we can all be like the Jetsons
981,4,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I‚Äôm impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it‚Äôs definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can‚Äôt use my Apple Music account."
3046,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have."
555,5,13-Jun-18,Black,I purchased this refurbished.  Works just like brand new.  3 minute set up. Very easy.  Now I have echo dot that I can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system.
909,4,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated."
885,3,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,I like the interaction of asking questions. I don‚Äôt like that I can‚Äôt ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.
1088,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,I love it!  I especially love that it is so small and does so much.  Got rid of my old CD/Alarm clock radio.  Much more room on nightstand.
2789,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Barry
2081,5,3-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Good product I like it . Thank you !
150,3,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music."
1780,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"Tons of features and skills, and a very good speaker with plenty of bass for music. You still need some work on the AI, in responding to random questions though. My Android phone is far better at those... with the Echo I still get a lot of &#34;hmm, I'm not sure&#34; or &#34;I don't have an opinion on that.&#34;"
450,5,4-Jul-18,Black,"Excellent product, mint condition for a refurbished unit - you would never know it's been refurbished!"
763,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Does everything as expected and more.
1512,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,You can't access YouTube! Why do consumer's have to pay for this argument! Why can't we just have a good product that offers what we need?
937,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Listen music and set timer
936,5,29-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,"This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc."
192,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!
1711,5,28-Jul-18,White  Show,Super easy set up! Great features! FUN!
1966,5,25-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"How can you not like the Echo Plus.  It has the built in Hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices.  Amazon makes a great product and I haven't had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices (echo dots, etc.)."
1114,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,I love my Echo Spot.  Waking to my favorite music.  Being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark.  All the skills I have yet to try.  Easy to use.
2127,4,31-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Love it!
2559,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item."
2897,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Works like a champ.
2929,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,"We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of."
705,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly."
2915,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Great product - understands my accent!
2877,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love my echo dot easy to use and set up
3004,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I love it.
1450,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,Thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.
2818,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Love it! Very helpful
574,5,10-Jun-18,White,"Bought a refurb, and its works just as my new ones I bought prior! Came in original packaging as well!"
1717,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,Glad I upgraded my aka
1207,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Easy to use easy to set up
2462,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love this thing works great and kids love it to
324,4,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We‚Äôve had it 7 months and it‚Äôs just kinda useless.
2198,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,works great
1486,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,I love it.
2243,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Very easy to use! Makes finding shows and movies a snap.
381,1,25-Jul-18,White,It worked for a month or so then it stopped. I've tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working. I want a refund
2880,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"I love being able to control lights, doors and music."
2970,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.
469,5,1-Jul-18,Black,Works great just like the new one that i already had.
1534,5,30-Jul-18,White  Show,"Love the echo show, can keep I can video chat with the kids and grandkids. I have it in the kitchen, so when I run out of something I have Alexa to add it to my grocery list. I use it for everything. Was very easy to set up"
220,5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Cool
1755,5,30-Jul-18,White  Plus,"I like the built in hub. Plus the unit sounds great, just wish it had a volume control on it."
596,5,6-Jun-18,Black,Works great with my existing smart home setup.
3106,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,neat tool we enjoy it with the family
1215,4,27-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"Yes it met my expectations.  The snooze on the alarm needs a but of work.  Tap it and it snoozes, swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss.  But without my glasses I can't read it and often it just snoozes.  Then one day I must have dismissed tomorrow's alarm because it never went off.  I have it set for Mon-Thu.  Fri I don't need to get up early.  A more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice.  My old alarm had a red light."
1686,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,"I absolutely love this thing. And I love AMAZON because my Echo Show went bonkers and all it took was a brief chat and Voila, a new one to replace it is on the way. I was floored when the screen started blurring and shaking and jumping and missing part of its data. Alexa still talked but I couldn't watch movies. SO HAPPY that Amazon is so easy to deal with and makes good on its products without any hassle at all."
282,5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Nice product A+
953,4,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"
2183,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,awesome device
1973,5,25-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Works well. Need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well.
2941,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Not impressed

2884,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,"I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too."
1575,3,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,"After two weeks I am not sure if I like the ever present Alexa to have a screen as well.  I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to."
1806,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,I have the google home that I really like. The Echo plus I think has even a better sound and am totally happy with it.
584,5,8-Jun-18,Black,"Bought two of them and both work great. I'm not much on electronics running my home, but Alexa does all that I want and need to be done."
1618,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,Got this on Amazon prime with the ring pro. Work really great. Being the lazy guy I am I don't need to go see who at my door anymore while I'm gaming.

346,5,28-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,From such a small speaker it sounds great
3021,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.
1098,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"i had a couple of echo dots previously - bought these _SPECIFICALLY_ for the Ring doorbell video / cloud cam display / interface capabilities. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. Love the fact that I can ask to see front yard / back yard / front door, etc.the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool.BONUS: ‚ÄúAlexa show me Ant Man trailer, etc‚Äùi know this can all be done on laptop/desktop, but it‚Äôs cool now having an ‚Äòappliance‚Äô that‚Äôs always just there, and it doesn‚Äôt interrupt what i‚Äôm doing."
1440,4,30-Jul-18,White  Show,"Love the product idea. Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it's supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it's too bad bc it's like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it's not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo. I may still exchange the product."
